# Datashader

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bokeh/datashader.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/bokeh/datashader)

The Datashader project is focused on building better ways to visualize
very large datasets, using intelligent server-side downsampling,
automatic computations performed on the data as it progresses through
the visualization pipeline, and other related techniques.  The project
is under active development, and all the code and documentation is
subject to frequent changes.
