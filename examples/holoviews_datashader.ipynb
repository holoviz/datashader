    "# Using Datashader with Bokeh in HoloViews\n",
    "\n",
    "[HoloViews](http://holoviews.org) (1.7 and later) is a high-level data analysis and visualization library that makes it simple to generate interactive [Datashader](https://github.com/bokeh/datashader)-based plots in [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org).  Using these three tools together, it is simple to work with billions or more points interactively in a web browser:\n",

    "Basically, HoloViews makes it simple to switch between Datashader and regular plots when creating interactive web visualizations.  A developer willing to do more programming can do all the same things separately, using Bokeh and Datashader's APIs directly, but with HoloViews it is much simpler to explore and analyze data.  And you can also use datashader without either Bokeh or HoloViews (the light gray lines above), but then you'll need to do a *lot* more work yourself.\n",

    "Decimating a plot in this way can be useful, but it discards most of the data, yet still suffers from overplotting. If you have Datashader installed, you can instead use the `datashade()` operation from HoloViews to create a dynamic Datashader-based Bokeh plot.  (Here `datashade()` is just a convenient shortcut for the two main steps in data shading, i.e., `shade(aggregate())`, which can also be invoked separately.) The middle plot above shows the result of using `datashade()` to create a dynamic Datashader-based plot out of an Element with arbitrarily large data.  In the Datashader version, a new image is regenerated automatically on every zoom or pan event, revealing all the data available at that zoom level and avoiding issues with overplotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two Datashader-based plots are similar to the native Bokeh plots above, but instead of making a static Bokeh plot that embeds points or line segments directly into the browser, HoloViews sets up a Bokeh plot with dynamic callbacks that render the data as an RGB image using Datashader instead.  The dynamic re-rendering provides an interactive user experience even though the data itself is never provided directly into the browser.  Of course, because the full data is not in the browser, a static export of this page (e.g. on anaconda.org) will only show the initially rendered version, and will not update with new images when zooming as it will when there is a live Python process available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though you can no longer have a completely interactive exported file, with the Datashader version on a live server you can now change 1000000 to 10000000 or more to see how well your machine will handle larger datasets. It will get a bit slower, but if you have enough memory, it should still be very usable, and should never crash your browser as transferring the whole dataset into your browser would.  If you don't have enough memory, you can instead set up a [Dask](http://dask.pydata.org) dataframe as shown in other Datashader examples, which will provide out of core and/or distributed processing to handle even the largest datasets."

    "\n",
    "However, many monitors are sufficiently high resolution that the resulting point or line can be difficult to see---a single pixel may not actually be visible on its own, and the color of it is likely to be very difficult to make out.  To compensate for this issue, HoloViews provides access to Datashader's image-based \"spreading\", which makes isolated pixels \"spread\" into adjacent ones for visibility.  Because the amount of spreading that's useful depends on how close the datapoints are to each other on screen, the most useful such function is `dynspread`, which spreads up to a maximum sized as long as it does not exceed a specified fraction of adjacency between pixels.  You can compare the results in the two plots below after zooming in:"
