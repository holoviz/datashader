    "\n",
    "However, it's very tricky to set the size and alpha parameters.  How do we know if certain regions are saturating, unable to show peaks in dropoff density? Here we've manually set the alpha to show a clear structure of streets and blocks, as one would intuitively expect to see, but the density of dropoffs still seems approximately the same on nearly all Manhattan streets (just wider in some locations), which is unlikely to be true. We can of course reduce the alpha value to reduce saturation further, but there's no way to tell when it's been set correctly, and it's already low enough that nothing other than Manhattan and La Guardia is showing up at all. Plus, this alpha value will only work even reasonably well at the one zoom level shown. Try zooming in (may need to enable the wheel zoom tool in the upper right) to see that at higher zooms, there is less overlap between dropoff locations, so that the points *all* start to become transparent due to lack of overlap. Yet without setting the size and alpha to a low value in the first place, the stucture is invisible when zoomed out, due to overplotting. Thus even though Bokeh provides rich support for interactively revealing structure by zooming, it is of limited utility for large data; either the data is invisible when zoomed in, or there's no large-scale structure when zoomed out, which is necessary to indicate where zooming would be informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we're still ignoring 99% of the data.  Many plotting programs will have trouble with plots even this large, but Bokeh can handle 100-200,000 points in most browsers. Here we've enabled Bokeh's WebGL support, which gives smoother zooming behavior, but the non-WebGL mode also works well. Still, for such large sizes the plots become slow due to the large HTML file sizes involved, because each of the data points are encoded as text in the web page, and for even larger samples the browser will fail to render the page at all.  \n",

Instead of using a Bokeh scatterplot, which encodes every point into JSON and stores it in the HTML file read by the browser, we can use the [datashader](https://github.com/bokeh/datashader) library to render the entire dataset into a pixel buffer in a separate Python process, and then provide a fixed-size image to the browser containing only the data currently visible. This approach decouples the data processing from the visualization.  The data processing is then limited only by the computational power available, while the visualization has much more stringent constraints determined by your display device (a web browser and your particular monitor, in this case). This approach works particularly well when your data is in a far-off server, but it is also useful whenever your dataset is larger than your display device can render easily.\n",

    "Because the number of points involved is no longer a limiting factor, you can now use the entire dataset (including the full 150 million trips that have been made public, if you download that data separately).

For instance, histogram equalization was done on the counts in the aggregate array, because if we waited until the image had been created, we would have been working with data truncated to the 256 color levels available per channel in most display devices, greatly reducing precision.  Or you may want to focus specifically on the highest peaks (as shown below), which again should be done at the aggregate level so that you can use the full color range of your display device to represent the narrow range of data that you are interested in.

    "Here the order of colors is roughly red (midnight), yellow (4am), green (8am), cyan (noon), blue (4pm), purple (8pm), and back to red (since hours and colors are both cyclic). There are clearly hotspots by hour that can now be investigated, and perhaps compared with the underlying map data.  And you can try first filtering the dataframe to only have weekdays or weekends, or only during certain public events, etc., or filtering the resulting pixels to have only those in a certain range of interest.  The system is very flexible, and it should be straightforward to express a very large range of possible queries and visualizations with very little code.\n",
