    "# Visualizing water depth into the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays\n",
    "\n",
    "Many natural phenomena exhibit wide differences in the amount they vary across space, with properties varying quickly in some regions of space, and very slowly in others. These differences can make it challenging to make feasible, accurate models using a fixed sampling grid. For instance, for hydrology modelling, areas that are largely flat and uniform can be approximated with just a few samples, while areas of sharp elevation change need many samples per unit area to have a faithful representation of how water will flow.  [Datashader](http://datashader.org)'s support for irregular triangular meshes allows datasets from such simulations to be rendered onscreen efficiently. This notebook shows an example of rendering a dataset from the Chesapeake and Delaware Bay off the US Eastern coast, using data downloaded from the [Datashader examples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bokeh/datashader/master/examples/README.md). Once Datashader and the dataset are installed, you can run this notebook yourself to get a live version with interactive zooming for the plots that support it.\n",
