    "Based on our [testing with various file formats](https://github.com/holoviz/datashader/issues/129), we recommend storing\n",
    "any large columnar datasets in the [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) format when\n",
    "possible, using the [fastparquet](https://github.com/dask/fastparquet) library with [Snappy](https://github.com/andrix/python-snappy) compression:\n",

    "## Data libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Datashader performance will vary significantly depending on the library used to represent the data in Python, because different libraries have very different abilities to use the available processing power and memory. Moreover, different libraries are appropriate for different types of data, due to how those libraries organize and store the data internally as well as the operations they provide for working with the data. The data libraries currently supported by Datashader are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org): Basic columnar data support, typically lower performance than the other options where those are supported. Does not typically support multi-threaded operation that can make full use of your CPU's cores, and is generally limited to datasets that fit in your CPU's accessible memory. Does not support ragged arrays like polygons efficiently on its own.\n",
    "- [Dask](https://dask.org): Multi-threaded support built on Pandas that can make full use of your CPU's cores, distributed support for using multiple CPUs in a cluster, HPC system or the cloud, and out-of-core support for datasets larger than memory. \n",
    "- [cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf): NVIDIA GPU support, for datasets in GPU memory and processed by a GPU.\n",
    "- [Dask_cuDF](https://rapidsai.github.io/projects/cudf/en/0.10.0/10min.html): Multi-GPU support for computation distributed across multiple NVIDIA GPUs on the same or different machines\n",
    "- [SpatialPandas](https://github.com/holoviz/spatialpandas): Pandas extended to support efficient storage and computation on ragged arrays for polygons and variable-length lines, typically on one core of one CPU\n",
    "- [Dask+SpatialPandas](https://github.com/holoviz/spatialpandas): SpatialPandas combined with Dask to support multi-core, distributed, and out-of-core processing.\n",
    "- [Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org): Efficient, Dask-based multidimensional (not columnar or ragged) array operation, including support for multi-core, distributed, and out-of-core processing on CPUs.\n",
    "- [Xarray+CuPy](https://cupy.chainer.org): Xarray multidimensional array processing on an NVIDIA GPU.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Yes**: Supported\n",
    "- **No**: Not (yet) supported, but could be with sufficient development effort (feel free to contribute effort or funding!)\n",
    "- **-**: Not supported because that combination is not normally appropriate or useful (e.g. columnar data libraries will not provide efficient multidimensional array support)\n",
