The \"Small dots\" setting (size 0.1, full alpha) works fairly well for a sample of 600 points **A**, but it has serious overplotting issues for larger datasets, obscuring the shape and density of the distribution **B**.  Using the \"Tiny dots\" setting (10 times smaller dots, alpha 0.1) works well for the larger dataset **D**, but not at all for the 600-point dataset **C**.  Clearly, not all of these settings are accurately conveying the underlying distribution, as they all appear quite different from one another. Similar problems occur for the same size of dataset, but with greater or lesser levels of overlap between points, which of course varies with every new dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, as dataset size increases, at some point plotting a full scatterplot like any of these will become impractical with current plotting software.  At this point, people often simply subsample their dataset, plotting 10,000 or perhaps 100,000 randomly selected datapoints.  But as panel **A** shows, the shape of an **undersampled** distribution can be very difficult or impossible to make out, leading to incorrect conclusions about the distribution.  Such problems can occur even when taking very large numbers of samples, if examining sparsely populated regions of the space, which will approximate panel **A** for some plot settings and panel **C** for others.  The actual shape of the distribution is only visible if sufficient datapoints are available in that region *and* appropriate plot settings are used, as in **D**, but ensuring that both conditions are true is a quite difficult process of trial and error, making it very likely that important features of the dataset will be missed.\n",

    "Yes, if we think of the visualization problem in a different way.  The underlying difficulty in plotting this dataset (as for very many real-world datasets) is that the values in each bin are numerically very different (ranging from 10,000, in the bin for the \"very narrow spread\" Gaussian, to 1 (for single datapoints from the \"very large spread\" Gaussian)).  Given the 256 gray levels available in a normal monitor (and the similarly limited human ability to detect differences in gray values), numerically mapping the data values into the visible range is not going to work well.  But given that we are already backing off from a direct numerical mapping in the above approaches for correcting undersaturation and for doing log transformations, what if we entirely abandon the numerical mapping approach, using the numbers only to form a partial ordering of the data values?  Such an approach would be a rank-order plot, preserving order and not magnitudes.  For 100 gray values, you can think of it as a percentile-based plot, with the lowest 1% of the data values mapping to the first visible gray value, the next 1% mapping to the next visible gray value, and so on to the top 1% of the data values mapping to the gray value 255 (black in this case).  The actual data values would be ignored in such plots, but their relative magnitudes would still determine how they map onto colors on the screen, preserving the structure of the distribution rather than the numerical values.\n",

Thus on those monitors, the highest values may not be  clearly distinguishable from each other or from nearby grey values, which is a possible downside to fully utilizing the dynamic range available.  But once the data is reliably and automatically mapped into a repeatable, reliable, fully utilized range for display, making explicit adjustments (e.g. based on wanting to make hotspots particularly clear) can be done in a principled way that doesn't depend on the actual data distribution (e.g. by just making the top few pixel values into a different color, or by stretching out those portions of the color map to show the extremes more safely across different monitors). Before getting into such specialized manipulations, there's a big pitfall to avoid first:\n",

    "Let's say you've managed avoid pitfalls 1-5 somehow.  However, there is one more problem waiting to catch you at the last stage, ruining all of your work eliminating the other issues: using a perceptually non-uniform colormap.  A heatmap requires a colormap before it can be visualized, i.e., a lookup table from a data value (typically a normalized magnitude in the range 0 to 1) to a pixel color.  The goal of a scientific visualization is to reveal the underlying properties of the data to your visual system, and to do so it is necessary to choose colors for each pixel that lead the viewer to perceive that data faithfully.  Unfortunately, most of the colormaps in common use in plotting programs are highly *non*uniform.  \n",

    "For instance, in \"jet\" (the default colormap for matlab and matplotlib until 2015), a large range of data values will all appear in shades of green that are perceptually indistinguishable, and similarly for the yellow regions of their \"hot\" colormaps:\n",

    "Comparing **A**  to **B** it should be clear that the \"fire\" colormap is revealing much more of the data, accurately rendering the density differences between each of the different blobs.  The unsuitable \"hot\" colormap is mapping all of the high density regions to perceptually indistinguishable shades of bright yellow/white, giving an \"oversaturated\" appearance even though we know the underlying heatmap array is *not* oversaturated (by construction).  Luckily it is easy to avoid this problem; just use a perceptually uniform colormap like one of the 90 available in the [colorcet](https://colorcet.pyviz.org) package, one of the four shipped with matplotlib [(viridis, plasma, inferno, or magma)](https://bids.github.io/colormap), or the Parula colormap shipped with Matlab.\n",

Datashader avoids users having to make dataset-dependent decisions and parameter settings when visualizing a new dataset.  Datashader makes it practical to create accurate visualizations of datasets too large to understand directly, up to a billion points on a normal laptop and larger datasets on a compute cluster.
