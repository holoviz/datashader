    "In many domains it is common to plot scalar values as a function of time (or other single dimensions).  As long as the total number of datapoints is relatively low (in the tens of thousands, perhaps) and there are only a few separate curves involved, most plotting packages will do well.  However, for longer or more frequent sampling, you'll be required to subsample your data before plotting, potentially missing important peaks or troughs in the data.

    "Here, each line represents an independent trial of this random walk process.  All lines start from the same point at time 0 (all the way to the left). At each subsequent time step, each line moves upward or downward from its prior position by a distance drawn from a normal distribution.  Thanks to the nonlinear `eq-hist` colorization, you can see the dispersion in the density of the overall distribution as time advances, at the same time as you can see the individual outliers at the extremes of the distribution.  You'll see a similar plot for 1,000,000 or 10,000,000 curves, and much more interesting plots if you have real data to show!"
