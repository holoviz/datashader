In some cases, your data is *already* rasterized, such as data from imaging experiments, simulations on a regular grid, or other regularly sampled processes.

The ``mode`` version computes the most common value that overlaps this pixel (not very useful for floating-point data as here, but important for categorical data where ``mean`` would not be valid; in that case you can also use `first` or `last` to take the first or last value found for a given pixel). The ``std`` version reports the standard deviation of the grid cells in each pixel, which is low towards the lower left where the function is smooth, and increases towards the upper right, where the function value varies significantly per pixel (i.e., has many samples in the original grid with different values).\n",

These aliasing effects are clearly visible in the ``min`` and ``max`` aggregation, because they keep the local minimum or maxiumum rather than averaging out the artifacts.  Comparing ``mean`` and ``min`` or ``max`` (or subtracting ``min`` from ``max``) can help find regions of the array that are being poorly represented in the current view.\n",
