    "With GPS-enabled devices, it's easy to collect a large quantity of trajectory data, i.e. a connected series of points in 2D or 3D.  However, it's not so easy to plot large datasets with most plotting programs, and so people generally downsample the trajectories, which can hide important features of the data.  Here we show how to use [datashader](https://github.com/bokeh/datashader) to look at *all* the datapoints even for large datasets, faithfully displaying the data at the highest level, while revealing additional structure when examining small regions of the data."
