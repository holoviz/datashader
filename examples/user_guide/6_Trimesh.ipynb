    "# Triangle Meshes\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with [points](2_Points.ipynb), [timeseries](3_Timeseries.ipynb), [trajectories](4_Trajectories.ipynb), and [rasters](5_Rasters.ipynb), Datashader can rasterize large triangular meshes, such as those often used to simulate data on an irregular grid:\n",

    "\n",
    "Any polygon can be represented as a set of triangles, and any shape can be approximated by a polygon, so the triangular-mesh support has many potential uses. \n",
    "\n",
    "In each case, the triangular mesh represents (part of) a *surface*, not a volume, and so the result fits directly into a 2D plane rather than requiring 3D rendering. This process of rasterizing a triangular mesh means generating values along specified regularly spaced intervals in the plane.  These examples from the [Direct3D docs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/cc627092.aspx) show how this process works, for a variety of edge cases:\n",
    "<img width=500 src=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/dynimg/IC520311.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This diagram uses \"pixels\" and colors (grayscale), but for datashader the raster is more precisely interpreted as a 2D array with bins, not pixels, because the values involved are numeric rather than colors.  (With datashader, colors are assigned only in the later \"shading\" stage, not during rasterization itself.) As shown in the diagram, a pixel (bin) is treated as belonging to a given triangle if its center falls either inside that triangle or along its top or left edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific algorithm used to do so is based on the approach of [Pineda (1998)](http://people.csail.mit.edu/ericchan/bib/pdf/p17-pineda.pdf), which has the following features:\n",
    "  * Classification of pixels relies on triangle convexity\n",
    "  * Embarrassingly parallel linear calculations\n",
    "  * Inner loop can be calculated incrementally, i.e. with very \"cheap\" computations\n",
    "  \n",
    "and a few assumptions: \n",
    "  * Triangles should be non overlapping (to ensure repeatable results for different numbers of cores)\n",
    "  * Triangles should be specified consistently either in clockwise or in counterclockwise order of vertices (winding). \n",
    "  \n",
    "Like the rest of Datashader, trimesh rasterization does not (yet) use the GPU; it's fast because of [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org) compiling Python into SIMD machine code instructions."
