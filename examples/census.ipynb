    "\n",
    "The 2010 Census collected a variety of demographic information for all the more than 300 million people in the USA.  Here we'll focus on the subset of the data selected by the Cooper Center, who produced a map of the population density and the racial makeup of the USA (http://www.coopercenter.org/demographics/Racial-Dot-Map).  Each dot in this map corresponds to a specific person counted in the census, located approximately at their residence. (To protect privacy, the precise locations have been randomized at the block level, so that the racial category can only be determined to within a rough geographic precision.) The Cooper Center website delivers pre-rendered tiles, which is fast but limited to the plotting choices they made; here we will show how to run novel analyses focusing on whatever aspects of the data that you select yourself, rendered dynamically as requested using the [datashader](https://github.com/bokeh/datashader) library.\n",

    "## Load data and set up\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's load this data using [dask](http://dask.pydata.org).  Dask lets you work with data in a variety of formats, and supports both in-core and out-of-core operation.  In-core operation is faster, so here we'll direct dask to load the entire dataset into memory (`df.cache(cache=dict)` below), but if you have less than 16GB RAM you may want to comment out that line to enable the out-of-core support. The data have been converted into castra format, which supports quick access, but CSV could have been used (with some performance penalty)."

Effectively, this transformation converts the data from raw magnitudes, which can easily span a much greater range than the dynamic range visible to the eye, to a rank-order or percentile representation, which reveals density differences at all ranges but obscures the absolute magnitudes involved. In this representation, you can clearly see the effects of geography (rivers, coastlines, and mountains) on the population density, as well as history (denser near the longest-populated areas), and even infrastructure (with many small towns located at crossroads).\n",

If both plots are similar, then the data is distributed nearly uniformly across the interval.  But much more commonly, the distribution will be highly nonlinear, and the linear plot will reveal only the envelope of the data, i.e., the lowest and the highest values.  In such cases, the histogram-equalized plot will reveal much more of the structure of the data, because it maps the local patterns in the data into perceptible color differences on the screen.\n",

E.g. you can try posing questions that are independent of the number of datapoints in each pixel, since that varies so much geographically, by normalizing the aggregated data in various ways. Now that the data's been aggregated but not yet rendered to the screen, there is an infinite range of queries you can pose!"
