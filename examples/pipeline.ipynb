    "# Controlling the `datashader` pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "`datashader` is a flexible Python library designed to expose the stages involved in generating a visualization.  These stages can then be automated, configured, customized, or replaced wherever appropriate for a data analysis task.  The main stages in a datashader pipeline are similar to those in a [3D graphics rendering pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_pipeline):\n",

This pipeline provides all of the power of `datashader`, because only the first couple of stages require the full dataset, and the remaining stages use a fixed-sized data structure regardless of the input dataset, making it practical to work with even extremely large datasets.\n",

There are two glyphs provided with the library: a `Point` glyph, which will map the datapoint into the single closest grid cell to that datapoint's location, and a `Line` glyph that maps that point into every grid cell falling between this point and the next.  You can create other `Glyph` types for custom purposes, such as shading a point onto a set of bins according to some kernel function or some uncertainty value, although implementing a new glyph is more difficult than customizing the other components of the pipeline.

Given an aggregate bin to update (typically corresponding to one eventual pixel) and a new datapoint, the reduction operator updates the state of the bin in some way.

In practice, only a few categories can be reliably distinguished in this way, but zooming in (as shown below) can be used to help disambiguate overlapping colors, as long as the basic set of colors is itself distinguishable.\n",

    "\n",
    "In each of the above examples, you may have noticed that we never needed to specify any parameters about the data values; the plots just appear like magic.  That magic is implemented in `tf.shade`.  What `tf.shade` does for a 2D aggregate (non-categorical) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mask** out all bins with a `NaN` value (for floating-point arrays) or a zero value (for integer arrays); these bins will not have any effect on subsequent computations.  Unfortunately, integer arrays do not support `NaN`; using zero as a pseudo-`NaN` works well for counts but not for all integer data, which is something that may need to be generalized in a future version of the library (a [to-do item](https://github.com/bokeh/datashader/issues/142)).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Transform** the bin values using a specified scalar function `how`.  Calculates the value of that function for the difference between each bin value and the minimum non-masked bin value.  E.g. for `how=\"linear\"`, simply returns the difference unchanged.  Other `how` functions are discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Map** the resulting transformed data array into the provided colormap.  First finds the value span (*l*,*h*) for the resulting transformed data array -- what are the lowest and highest non-masked values?  -- and then maps the range (*l*,*h*) into the full range of the colormap provided.  Masked values are given a fully transparent alpha value, and non-masked ones are given a fully opaque alpha value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is thus auto-ranged to show whatever data values are found in the aggregate bins (though the `span` argument can be used to set the range explicitly where appropriate).\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in plotting_pitfalls.ipynb, auto-ranging is only part of what is required to reveal the structure of the dataset; it's also crucial to automatically and potentially nonlinearly map from the aggregate values (e.g. bin counts) into the colormap. If we used a linear mapping, we'd see very little of the structure of the data:"

Using `how` also helps simplify the subsequent ***Embedding*** stage, letting it provide one of a fixed set of legend types, either linear (for `how=linear`), logarithmic (for `how=log`) or percentile (for `how=eq_hist`).  See the [shade docs](http://datashader.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html#datashader.transfer_functions.shade) for more details on the `how` functions.
