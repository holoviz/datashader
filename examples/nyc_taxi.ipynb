Bokeh performs fairly well with 100,000 points (unlike many plotting programs), though plotting is definitely getting slower in this case. (Bokeh generates a very large HTML file to be read by the browser, because it contains each point represented individually).  More importantly, it's very tricky to set the size and alpha parameters.  How do we know if certain regions are saturating so that density differences are obscured?  Here we've set the alpha to show a clear structure of streets and blocks, as one would expect to see, but the density of dropoffs still seems approximately the same on all Manhattan streets (just wider in some locations), which is unlikely to be true.  Plus, this alpha value will work only at the one zoom level shown; if we zoom in there will be less overlap between dropoff locations, and we'll need to lower the transparency of each point.

Yet very little of the other structure of the dataset is visible -- most areas *appear* to have no dropoffs. To see if that's really true, let's set the color for pixels that have at least one dropoff as a light color, and then interpolate from there for higher values.  With datashading, it's easy to do that, because one can express computations not just on the data, but on the visualization.  In the resulting plot (below), it is obvious that most areas *do* have dropoffs, and that there is rich structure in this data.  But the result is still quite unsatisfactory -- most regions of Manhattan seem to be nearly uniformly densely populated with dropoffs, apart from the very largest Penn one Times Square peak and some dimly visible street outlines: "
