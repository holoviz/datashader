    "### How can I get legends and colorbars for my Datashader plot?\n",
    "\n",
    "When used as a standalone library, Datashader can only generate images or bare arrays; it does not have any concept of axes, legends, or colorbars. But Datashader is designed to work well as a rendering engine for other plotting libraries that do offer those features. For the specific case of colorbars, just ensure that you are letting the separate plotting library do the colormapping, not Datashader, and you should be able to get full support for colorbars. That is, use Datashader to aggregate the image into a fixed array of values, and then use Bokeh, Plotly, or Holoviews to colormap and render the array as pixels, which will allow the plotting library to construct a suitable colormap. For instance, to get a colorbar in HoloViews, use `rasterize()` to invoke datashader on the data and generate an array of values; do not use `datashade()`, which would `rasterize()` while also calling `shade()` to generate RGB pixel values, at which point the plotting library would not be able to report the mapping from value to color, as it only would have seen the final RGB values. Of course, if you let the plotting library do the colormapping, you will no longer be able to use Datashader-specific features like histogram equalization, which would then need to be implemented by the plotting library (as now done for Bokeh) if you want to have colorbars for such cases."
