    "# Embedding Datashader with HoloViews\n",
    "\n",
    "[HoloViews](http://holoviews.org) (1.7 and later) is a high-level data analysis and visualization library that makes it simple to generate interactive [Datashader](https://github.com/holoviz/datashader)-based plots.  Here's an illustration of how this all fits together when using HoloViews+[Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org):\n",

    "HoloViews offers a data-centered approach for analysis, where the same tool can be used with small data (anything that fits in a web browser's memory, which can be visualized with Bokeh directly), and large data (which is first sent through Datashader to make it tractable) and with several different plotting frontends.  A developer willing to do more programming can do all the same things separately, using Bokeh, Matplotlib, and Datashader's APIs directly, but with HoloViews it is much simpler to explore and analyze data. Of course, the [previous notebook](1-Pipeline.ipynb) showed that you can also use datashader without either any plotting library at all (the light gray pathways above), but then you wouldn't have interactivity, axes, and so on.\n",
    "\n",

Each time you zoom or pan, the callback will be given the new viewport that's now visible, and datashader will render a new image to update the display. The result makes it look as if all of the data is available in the web browser interactively, while only ever storing a single image at any one time.
