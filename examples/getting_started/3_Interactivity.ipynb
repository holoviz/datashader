    "[HoloViews](https://holoviews.org) (1.7 and later) is a high-level data analysis and visualization library that makes it simple to generate interactive [Datashader](https://github.com/holoviz/datashader)-based plots.  Here's an illustration of how this all fits together when using HoloViews+[Bokeh](https://bokeh.org):\n",

A developer willing to do more programming can do all the same things separately, using Bokeh, Matplotlib, and Datashader's APIs directly, but with HoloViews it is much simpler to explore and analyze data. Of course, the [previous notebook](1-Pipeline.ipynb) showed that you can also use datashader without either any plotting library at all (the light gray pathways above), but then you wouldn't have interactivity, axes, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
