For points, each datapoint is mapped into a single pixel, while the other glyphs have spatial extent and can thus map into multiple pixels, each of which operates the same way. All glyphs act like points if the entire glyph is contained within that pixel.

Given an aggregate bin to update (typically corresponding to one eventual pixel) and a new datapoint, the reduction operator updates the state of the bin in some way. (Actually, datapoints are normally processed in batches for efficiency, but it's simplest to think about the operator as being applied per data point, and the mathematical result should be the same.)

Choosing colors for different categories is more of an art than a science, because the colors not only need to be distinguishable, their combinations also need to be distinguishable if those categories ever overlap in nearby pixels, or else the results will be ambiguous.  In practice, only a few categories can be reliably distinguished in this way, but [zooming in](3_Interactivity.ipynb) can be used to help disambiguate overlapping colors, as long as the basic set of colors is itself distinguishable."

    "2. **Transform** the bin values using a specified scalar function `how`.  Calculates the value of that function for the difference between each bin value and the minimum non-masked bin value.  E.g. for `how=\"linear\"`, simply returns the difference unchanged.  Other `how` functions are discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Map** the resulting transformed data array into the provided colormap.  First finds the value span (*l*,*h*) for the resulting transformed data array -- what are the lowest and highest non-masked values?  -- and then maps the range (*l*,*h*) into the full range of the colormap provided. If a colormap is used, masked values are given a fully transparent alpha value, and non-masked ones are given a fully opaque alpha value. If a single color is used, the alpha value starts at `min_alpha` and increases proportionally to the mapped data value up to the full `alpha` value.\n",

Looking at such a plot, viewers have no easy way to determine which values are negative. Using a diverging colormap (right two plots) and forcing the span to be symmetric around zero ensures that negative values are plotted in one color range (reds) and positive are plotted in a clearly different range (blues).
