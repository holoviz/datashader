For this example, the \"x\" and \"y\" columns are conveniently named `x` and `y` already, but any column name can be used for these axes.\n",

    "   1. Calculating the ranges requires a complete pass over the data, which takes nearly as much time as actually aggregating the data, so your plots will be about twice as fast if you specify the ranges.\n",
    "   2. Real-world datasets often have some outliers with invalid values, which can make it difficult to see the real data, so after your first plot you will often want to specify only the range that appears to have valid data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once you have determined your mapping, you'll next need to choose a reduction operator to use when aggregating multiple datapoints into a given pixel. For points, each datapoint is mapped into a single pixel, while the other glyphs have spatial extent and can thus map into multiple pixels, each of which operates the same way. All glyphs act like points if the entire glyph is contained within that pixel. Here we will talk only about \"datapoints\" for simplicity, which for an area-based glyph should be interpreted as \"the part of that glyph that falls into this pixel\".\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the currently supported reduction operators are incremental, which means that we can efficiently process datasets in a single pass. Given an aggregate bin to update (typically corresponding to one eventual pixel) and a new datapoint, the reduction operator updates the state of the bin in some way. (Actually, datapoints are normally processed in batches for efficiency, but it's simplest to think about the operator as being applied per data point, and the mathematical result should be the same.) A large number of useful [reduction operators](https://datashader.org/api.html#reductions) are supplied in `ds.reductions`, including:\n",
    "\n",

    "**`summary(name1=op1,name2=op2,...)`**:\n",
    "  allows multiple reduction operators to be computed in a single pass over the data; just provide a name for each resulting aggregate and the corresponding reduction operator to use when creating that aggregate. If multiple aggregates are needed for the same dataset and the same Canvas, using `summary` will generally be much more efficient than making multiple separate passes over the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API documentation contains the complete list of [reduction operators](https://datashader.org/api.html#reductions) provided, including `mean`, `min`, `max`, `var` (variance), `std` (standard deviation).  The reductions are also imported into the ``datashader`` namespace for convenience, so that they can be accessed like ``ds.mean()`` here.\n",
    "\n",

    "In both of the above plots, values with no data are transparent as usual, showing white. With a sequential lightblue to blue colormap, increasing `val` numeric values are mapped to the colormap in order, with the smallest values (-40; large blob in the top left) getting the lowest color value (lightblue), less negative values (-20, blob in the bottom right) getting an intermediate color, and the largest average values (50, large distribution in the background) getting the highest color. Looking at such a plot, viewers have no easy way to determine which values are negative. Using a diverging colormap (right two plots) and forcing the span to be symmetric around zero ensures that negative values are plotted in one color range (reds) and positive are plotted in a clearly different range (blues). Note that when using a diverging colormap with transparent values, you should carefully consider what you want to happen around the zero point; here values with nearly zero average (blob in bottom left) disappear when using a white-centered diverging map (\"coolwarm\"), while they show up but in a neutral color when using a diverging map with a contrasting central color (\"CET_D8\").\n",

    "Here a `count` aggregate ignores the negative values and thus works the same as when values were positive, but `sum` and other aggregates like `mean` take the negative values into account. By default, a pixel with the lowest value (whether negative or positive) maps to `min_alpha`, and the highest maps to `alpha`.  The color is determined by how different each category's value is from the minimum value across all categories; categories with high values relative to the minimum contribute more to the color. There is not currently any way to tell which data values are positive or negative, as you can using a diverging colormap in the non-categorical case.\n",

    "Instead of using the default of the data minimum, you can pass a specific `color_baseline`, which is appropriate if your data has a well-defined reference value such as zero. Here, when we pass `color_baseline=0` the negative values are essentially ignored for color calculations, which can be seen on the green blob, where any orange data point is fully orange despite the presence of green-category datapoints; the middle plot `sum` shows a more appropriate color mixture in that case."
