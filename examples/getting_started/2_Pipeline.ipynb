    "Usually, however, such custom operations are done directly on the aggregate during the ***Transformation*** stage; the `how` operations are meant for simple, well-defined transformations solely for the final steps of visualization, which allows the main aggregate array to stay in the original units and scale in which it was measured.  Using `how` also helps simplify the subsequent ***Embedding*** stage, letting it provide one of a fixed set of legend types, either linear (for `how=linear`), logarithmic (for `how=log`) or percentile (for `how=eq_hist`).  See the [shade docs](http://datashader.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html#datashader.transfer_functions.shade) for more details on the `how` functions.
