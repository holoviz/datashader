    "Datashader is a graphics pipeline system for creating meaningful\n",
    "representations of large datasets quickly and flexibly. Datashader\n",
    "breaks the creation of images into a series of explicit steps that\n",
    "allow computations to be done on intermediate representations.  This\n",
    "approach allows accurate and effective visualizations to be produced\n",
    "automatically without trial-and-error parameter tuning, and also makes\n",
    "it simple for data scientists to focus on particular data and\n",
    "relationships of interest in a principled way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computation-intensive steps in this process are written in Python\n",
    "but transparently compiled to machine code using [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org) and flexibly\n",
    "distributed across cores and processors using [Dask](http://dask.pydata.org), providing a\n",
    "highly optimized rendering pipeline that makes it practical to work\n",
    "with extremely large datasets even on standard hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it concrete, here's an example of what Datashader code looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import datashader as ds, pandas as pd\n",
    "import datashader.transfer_functions as tf\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('user_data.csv')\n",
    "\n",
    "cvs = ds.Canvas(plot_width=400, plot_height=400)\n",
    "agg = cvs.points(df, 'x_col', 'y_col', ds.mean('z_col'))\n",
    "img = tf.shade(agg, cmap=['lightblue', 'darkblue'], how='log')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This code reads a data file into a Pandas dataframe `df`, and then\n",
    "projects the fields `x_col` and `y_col` onto the x and y dimensions of\n",
    "400x400 grid, aggregating it by the mean value of the `z_col` of each\n",
    "datapoint. The results are rendered into an image where the minimum\n",
    "count will be plotted in `lightblue`, the maximum in `darkblue`, and\n",
    "ranging logarithmically in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "With code like the above, you can plot 300 million points of data (one\n",
    "per person in the USA) from the 2010 census without any parameter tuning:\n",

    "Or you can plot attractors with 10 million points each, using random colormaps:\n",

    "Some of the original ideas for datashader were developed under the\n",

    "We recommend the [Getting Started Guide](getting_started) to learn\n",

    "The [API](api.html) is the definitive guide to each part of\n",

    "\n",
    "Please feel free to report [issues](https://github.com/pyviz/datashader/issues) or [contribute code](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests). You are also welcome to chat with the developers on [gitter](https://gitter.im/pyviz/pyviz).\n"
