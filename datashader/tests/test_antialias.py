"""Tests for antialiased line drawing in Datasahder"""

# The single-pixel width tests consist of 6 test cases, each drawing a
# different set of lines on a square canvas. Tests 1 to 4 are all sets of lines
# that start from the same point of origin and then disperse across the canvas
# to fill either an upper or a lower triangle. What follows is a simple
# ascii-art based cartoon to illustrate the setup. It only has 3 lines instead
# of nine and it is a cartoon within the limits of being able to draw angled
# lines on a square grid. The origin is the lower left corner and all nine
# lines are in the triangle below the diagonal.

# This is test_001. The following three tests 002, 003 and 004 are:
# * test_002: lower left corner as origin, lines in upper triangle
# * test_003: upper right corner as origin, lines in upper triangle
# * test_004: upper right corner as origin, lines in lower triangle
#
# The tests 005 and 006 use a different pattern, which is a combination of
# vertical and diagonal lines, where the angle of the diagonal lines
# 'increases'. Here is another cartoon to illustrate these tests cases that
# shows three verticals and two diagonals. As you can see, the angle between
# the vertical and the following diagonal increases from left to right.

#
# The big difference between 005 and 006 is that in 005 each line is individual
# line whereas for 006 it is a multi-segment line, and each vertex is listed
# only a single time. Datasahder then "connects the dots" as it were.
#
# Test 007 tests the edge case, where we draw an almost staright line between
# corners with only a single pixel offset. This is to ensure that anti-aliasing
# does not try to draw pixels that  are out of bounds. Importantly, this needs
# to be run with Numba disabled, since Numba does not do  OOB checking by
# default.

# So for each of these 7 patterns, we test a regular and a clipped version
# (the canvas is clipped to a region in the center) in both the normal and the
# anti-aliased drawing mode. This ensures that lines can be drawn in all
# directions and that clipping a canvas works. Tests 005 and 006 ensure that
# multi-line segments can be drawn correctly too.
#
# Each tests case comes with an image and a saved xarray file (serialized in
# the NetCDF format). The image is to aid visual inspection of the algorithm
# and the quality of the anti-aliasing. The serialized xarray is for automated
# testing. The __name__ == '__main__'  section can be used to re-generate both
# the NetCDF files and the PNG files.
