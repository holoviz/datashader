Getting Started

Installation
------------

Datashader supports Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 on Linux, Windows, or Mac
and can be installed with conda::

    conda install datashader

or with pip::

    pip install datashader

For the best performance, we recommend using conda so that you are
sure to get numerical libraries optimized for your platform.
The latest releases are available on the pyviz channel ``conda install -c pyviz datashader``
and the latest pre-release versions are available on the dev-labeled channel
``conda install -c pyviz/label/dev datashader``.

Fetching Examples
-----------------

Once you've installed datashader as above you can fetch the examples::

    datashader examples
    cd datashader-examples

This will create a new directory called `datashader-examples` with all the
data needed to run the examples.

To run all the examples you will need some extra dependencies. If you installed
datashader **within a conda environment**, with that environment active run::

    conda env update --file environment.yml

Otherwise create a new environment::

    conda env create --name datashader --file environment.yml
    conda activate datashader

Usage

Developer Instructions
----------------------

1. Install Python 3 `miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ or `anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_, if you don't already have it on your system.

2. Clone the datashader git repository if you do not already have it::

    git clone git://github.com/pyviz/datashader.git

3. Set up a new conda environment with all of the dependencies needed to run the examples::

    cd datashader
    conda env create --name datashader --file ./examples/environment.yml
    conda activate datashader

4. Put the datashader directory into the Python path in this environment::

    pip install -e .
