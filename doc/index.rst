Datashader is a graphics pipeline system for creating meaningful representations of large
datasets quickly and flexibly. Datashader breaks the creation of images into a series of explicit
steps that allow computations to be done on intermediate representations.  This approach allows
accurate and effective visualizations to be produced automatically without trial-and-error parameter
tuning, and also makes it simple for data scientists to focus on particular data and relationships
of interest in a principled way.

The computation-intensive steps in this process are written in ordinary Python
but transparently compiled to machine code using `Numba <https://numba.pydata.org>`_  and flexibly
distributed across CPU cores and processors using `Dask <https://dask.pydata.org>`_ or GPUs
using `CUDA <https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf>`_. This approach provides a highly optimized
rendering pipeline that makes it practical to work with extremely large datasets even on standard
hardware, while exploiting distributed and GPU systems when available.
