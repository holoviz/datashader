To learn how to use Datashader, see the `Getting Started Guide`_.

Detailed documentation is contained in the `User Guide`_.

NOTE: This is a list of links to examples on external sites. Most
examples are on https://examples.pyviz.org.

-  | `Census`_
   | Population and racial data from the 2010 US Census visualized as
     scatter points.

-  | `Gerrymandering`_
   | US Congressional boundaries overlaid on 2010 US Census data.

-  | `Landsat`_
   | Hyperspectral satellite imaging data from Landsat8 visualized as
     rasters.

-  | `Network Packets`_
   | PCAP network traffic data visualized as network graphs.

-  | `NYC Taxi`_
   | NYC Taxi data visualized as points, curves, and bars. Uses trip
     data originally from the `NYC Taxi dataset`_ but preprocessed using
     ``taxi_preprocessing_example.py`` for convenience.

-  | `OpenSky`_
   | OpenSky airplane trajectories visualized as points.

-  | `OSM 1 Billion`_
   | 1-billion-point OpenStreetMap dataset visualized as points on a
     laptop, in memory.

-  | `OSM`_
   | 2.7-billion-point OpenStreetMap dataset visualized as points on a
     laptop, out of core.

-  | `Dashboard`_
   | 30-line dashboard for datashader plots based on the `Panel`_
     library.

-  | `Strange attractors`_
   | Visualizing attractor trajectories for various iterative equations.

-  | `Bay Trimesh`_
   | Rendering a triangular mesh of water depths in the Chesapeake and
     Delaware bay areas.

-  | `Amazon.com center distance`_
   | Cities in the USA colored by their distance to the nearest
     Amazon.com distribution center.

-  | `UK Researchers`_
