**Turns even the largest data into images, accurately.**

Datashader is a graphics pipeline system for creating meaningful
representations of large datasets quickly and flexibly. Datashader
breaks the creation of images into a series of explicit steps that
allow computations to be done on intermediate representations.  This
approach allows accurate and effective visualizations to be produced
automatically without trial-and-error parameter tuning, and also makes
it simple for data scientists to focus on particular data and
relationships of interest in a principled way.

The computation-intensive steps in this process are written in Python
but transparently compiled to machine code using `Numba`_ and flexibly
distributed across cores and processors using `Dask`_, providing a
highly optimized rendering pipeline that makes it practical to work
with extremely large datasets even on standard hardware.

.. _`Numba`: http://numba.pydata.org

To make it concrete, here's an example of what datashader code looks like:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import datashader as ds
    >>> import datashader.transfer_functions as tf
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> df = pd.read_csv('user_data.csv')

    >>> cvs = ds.Canvas(plot_width=400, plot_height=400)
    >>> agg = cvs.points(df, 'x_col', 'y_col', ds.mean('z_col'))
    >>> img = tf.shade(agg, cmap=['lightblue', 'darkblue'], how='log')

This code reads a data file into a Pandas dataframe ``df``, and then
projects the fields ``x_col`` and ``y_col`` onto the x and y dimensions of
400x400 grid, aggregating it by the mean value of the ``z_col`` of each
datapoint. The results are rendered into an image where the minimum
count will be plotted in ``lightblue``, the maximum in ``darkblue``, and
ranging logarithmically in between.

And here are some sample outputs for 300 million points of data (one
per person in the USA) from the 2010 census, each constructed using
code like the above:

.. image:: images/usa_census.jpg

.. image:: images/nyc_races.jpg

You can watch a short talk about datashader on YouTube:
`Datashader: Revealing the Structure of Genuinely Big Data`_.
The video `Visualizing Billions of Points of Data,`_ and its `slides`_
from a February 2016 one-hour talk introducing Datashader are also
available, but do not cover more recent extensions to the library.

Some of the original ideas for datashader were developed under the
name Abstract Rendering, which is described in a `2014 SPIE VDA paper`_.

We recommend the `Getting Started Guide <getting_started>`_ to learn
the basic concepts and start using Datashader as quickly as possible.

The `User Guide <user_guide>`_ covers specific topics in more detail.

The `API <Reference_Manual>`_ is the definitive guide to each part of
Datashader, but the same information is available more conveniently via
the `help()` command as needed when using each component.
